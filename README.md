## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was mostly using this for more semantic html practice. I did learn about the border-collapse CSS attribute to help style the table in the nutrition section. I have generally styled tables with Bootstrap and was confused initially when I was trying to style just the rows. 

### Continued development

I am going to continue writing custom CSS and more semantic html code while incorporating React and/or Angular for larger projects/websites.

### Useful resources

- [border-collapse resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#borders) - Helped understand the border-collapse attribute and good information in general.
